# Starlette MVC Example
In this small project we are gonna create a small rest api, using [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and MVC pattern.


# Structure
- The project follows the MVC pattern.
- `models.py` is the models layer.
- `controllers.py` is the controller layer.
- `views.py` is the view layer.
- `server.py` is the application entrypoint.
